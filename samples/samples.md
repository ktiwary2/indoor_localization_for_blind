These png files show how the user is moving w.r.t to the localization module (yellow) versus the actual position (teal) when the user has deviated from the expected path. 
In such a scenario the localization module's projection of prior estimates would fail so it would have to adapt. We see here that the module has adapted well even after the user turns right instead of left. 

In this case the user does end up at the correct destination.
